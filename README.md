# do-nothing.vim

## Description

This plugin doesn't do anything.


## Installation

The use of a package manager is unnecessary, but since you probably use one anyway, here's an example with vim-plug:

```
Plug 'michaelb/do-nothing.vim'
```


## Usage
 - None

## Features
 - Fastest startup time among ALL Vim plugins
 - 100% code coverage
 - Works on any platform, OS, architecture, Vim/Neovim indifferently
 - Very low ressource usage
 - No ugly VimL, no badly written Python...: no room for any bug!
 - v1 is already stable and feature-complete
 - Ready to use, no configuration required


## Motivation:

 This plugin is useless, HOWEVER: as far as I know, it hasn't been done before. Most art is useless per se, 
 I wouldn't mind considering this a funny 'artistic' spin on vim plugin meta: if 'Vim plugin artists' are a thing, why not ?
